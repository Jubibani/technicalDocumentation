        <p>What is hello world? why not hi world? or hey there world</p>
        <p>Traditionally, Hello World programs are used to illustrate how the process of coding works, as well as to ensure that a language or system is operating correctly. They are usually the first programs that new coders learn, because even those with little or no experience can execute Hello World both easily and correctly.</p>
        <p> program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language</p>
        <p>“Hello, world!” is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.</p>
        <p>Above all, Hello World is simple. That’s why it is so often used as a barometer of program success.</p>
        <p>If Hello World does not work effectively within the framework, then it is likely that other, more complex programs will also fail. As one expert at Win-Vector puts it, Hello World is actually a confrontational program.</p>
        <p>“The author is saying ‘it isn’t obvious your computer system will work, so I am not going to invest a lot of time in it until I see it can at least print one line of text,’” Win-Vector blogger John Mount says.</p>
        <p>But this two-word phrase has big implications for the field of computer science. With Hello World as a foundation, novice programmers can easily understand computer science principles or elements.</p>
        <p> And professionals with years of coding experience can use it to learn how a given programming language works, especially in terms of structure and syntax.</p>
        <p>With applications at all skill levels and in almost every language, there is a long history behind such a short program.</p>

          <p><h3>Let's learn about esoteric languages.</h3></p>
        <p>JS Fuck is an esoteric language that is based on the atomic parts of JS and takes advantage of the fact that JS is a loosely-typed language.</p>
        <p>Beatnik is an esoteric language in which code looks like English-language text (typically with sentences that don't make a lot of sense). The words are scored according to the rules of the Scrabble board game, and the score is used to determine the operation</p>
        <p>INTERCAL
The earliest, and still the canonical example of an esoteric programming language, is INTERCAL, designed in 1972 by Don Woods and James M. Lyon, who said that their intention was to create a programming language unlike any with which they were familiar.</p>
        <p>why esoteric? Malbolge (named after the 8th circle of Hell) was designed to be the most difficult and esoteric programming language</p>
        <code>
          print("hello wor  ld")
          </code>
          <br>
          <code>
            System.out.println("Hello world")
            </code>
          <ul>
            <li>Programming is the process of creating instructions for a computer to execute.</li>
            <li>There are numerous programming languages, each with its own syntax and purpose.</li>
            <li>Programming requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills.</li>
            <li>Programmers often work in teams to develop and maintain software applications.</li>
            <li>The demand for skilled programmers continues to grow as technology advances.</li>
